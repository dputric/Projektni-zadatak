		<p>The Company´s history began in Zagreb with Union, a chocolate factory established in 1911. Nowadays, Kraš is a company that is run in a modern way, successfully adapting to market challenges. The parent’s operations are located in Zagreb and include the production of all three confectionery categories: chocolate, biscuits and wafers as well as candies.</p>
		<p>Apart from the Zagreb-located factories, Kraš owns another two biscuit and wafer factories: Karolina d.o.o., Osijek, situated in Croatia, and Mira a.d., Prijedor, operating in Bosnia and Herzegovina. And it is through joining together that Kraš has achieved a strategic goal of significantly increasing its share in the regional biscuit and wafer market, thus fulfilling the prerequisites to generate stronger sales of this range in other export markets.    </p>
		<p>The entire operations are run to international standards and the strictest requirements to achieve the premium quality. More than a half of total output is sold in the domestic market, while the rest is exported. </p>
		<p>From its beginnings until today, Kraš has developed its manufacturing tradition founded upon the superior quality of its products and their extensive range. Due to the cutting-edge manufacturing facilities combined with knowledge and rich experience of its experts, Kraš has built its position by manufacturing high-quality treats and growing original brands. Kraš brands not only occupy the leading positions in their respective product categories but are also among the strongest brands within the FCMG categories.</p>
		<p>Managing long-lasting and unique assets by way of their adaptation to the modern environment lies at the core of Kraš´ story. Over the years, the flagship brands of Kraš have evolved, adapted and have been given new looks, while continuously maintaining relationships with consumers and fulfilling their needs. </p>
